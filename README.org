* My Config
My config is mixed of configuration file I use in my linux laptop.
I am currently use Fedora 33, with Emacs's main editor.
Most configuration are install via (manually) symlink. It's work so far.
Also, I have "private" repo as submodule for files that contain sensitive information (like ip of my private server).
* Todo
- [ ] remove unnecessary files from private repo
- [ ] automate install symlink, (source ~/.bash_mybash in .bashrc)
- [ ] clean up bash function
